# Dataset Generation
### If you don't have any dataset to test the program on, you can use one of many programmatically generated datasets present in the `datasets/` folder.
### Or you can run the `dataset_gen.py` file to generate a dataset, which can also be configured to generate a certain number of rows, certain column names, certain mathematical equations to be used to generate columns, etc.
